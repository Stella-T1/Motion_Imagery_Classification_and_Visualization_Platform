# 🧠 Motion Imagery Classification and Visualization Platform

## 📖 Introduction

This repository provides a **visualization framework** for motion imagery EEG data analysis, emphasizing **topological mapping** and **Common Graph Subspace (CGS)** representations. Rather than implementing classification models, the current version focuses on enabling visual interpretation and feature space exploration of motion-related brain activity.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧩 Visualize EEG topological distributions
- 🔗 Generate and render Common Graph Subspace (CGS)
- 📊 Support comparative feature analysis under different motor imagery tasks

## 🧪 Dataset

The visualization is based on preprocessed EEG motion imagery datasets.

## 🖼️ Visualization Features

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧠 Topographic Maps | Spatial distribution of EEG signals across scalp layout |
| 🕸️ CGS Visualization | Common subspace graph across trials or subjects |
| 🛠️ Plot Tools | Using `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `mne` for rendering |
